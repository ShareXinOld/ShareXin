#### Troubleshooting

### Maim is difficult to compile
That's just the nature of maim, work it out and it's worth it.

### Gif fails to upload
It might be bigger than the Twitter API allows. Try creating the gif again, but shorter and smaller, or try optimizing the gif in ~/Pictures/Screenshots/ and manually uploading.
